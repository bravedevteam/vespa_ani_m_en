                                It's been 100 years since the Dark Lord Angmund has fallen by the king of Orvelia, Kyle. Kasel, 
                                a squire of the Guardian Knights, has been receiving his daily training by his senior Clause to become 
                                a knight that can protect people dear to him. Meanwhile, there is news that Demons that should've disappeared 
                                from the King's Forest of Orvelia have appeared again.
                                As Clause and his troops are being dispatched to the forest to inspect the Demons, 
                                Kasel wishes him luck and awaits his return.

                                In order to save his comrades, Kasel proceeds to the King's Forest with his childhood friend and a priestess, Frey.
                                However, what they saw in the forest was the corpse of his comrades and Clause's shield.
                                While they were driven to despair, a group of Demons suddenly approaches them.
                                The Black Edge, the mercenary hired by Orvelia saves them, but Kasel becomes frustrated with his helplessness as a squire.
                                Then, a wizard who calls herself Cleo and her escort, Roi appear and claim that they came to take Kasel and Frey to a certain place.

                                a gigantic island floating between the clouds. 
                                It was Dominix the Great Sage that wanted them here. 
                                And Kasel hears the momentous fact from Dominix - 100 years ago, King Kyle of Orvelia formed an alliance with 
                                Elfs and Orcs to exterminate the Demons that were invading and attacking humans. 
                                Then, Kasel finds out that King Kyle confronted the leader of the Demons, 
                                the Dark Lord Angmund with the Holy Sword bestowed by the Goddess of Light, Lua.

                                Then, an Elf named Selene appears and tells them that she would guide them to Lorraine.
                                However, Kasel and his party lose Selene on their way.
                                Elidora's Forest, alias [Forest of Delusion],
                                is famous for Elfs and Treants misbehaving to delude the travelers.
                                That was when a small Treant appeared before the bewildered Kasel and his party.

                                        As one of the heroes who fought against the Demons with King Kyle 100 years ago, 
                                        she is often considered the wisest person on the entire Orbis continent. 
                                        The king of Elidora and the descendants continue to pay their regards to this day.
                                        Having recently sensed a strange disturbance from the Elidora Forest, 
                                        she is preparing for the advent of the successor of the Holy Sword.

                                        A mercenary of noble birth with an energetic and free spirit personality.
                                        Since shehe prefers a life of freedom as a mercenary over the suffocating 
                                        life of a noble, it seems that she's completely lost all traces of her noble upbringing in her.
                                        Currently, she's wandering around the Orvelia after leaving the Empire.

                                        Since she is conservative as others of the forest, 
                                        she's hostile towards things that are unrelated to the races of the forest.
                                        She loves all races that belong in the forest and tries to protect them from Demons.
